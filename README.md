# 🧱 DirtBricks – Built by Us, Owned by No One  

Forget the promises. Forget the hype.  

DirtBricks isn’t here to **convince** you of its worth—because **blockchains, tokens, and names have no inherent value**.  
The **only** real value? **The fire in our souls. The strength of our hands. The force of our collective will.**  

## The Almighty Walls of Opportunity.  
DirtBricks doesn’t promise to be fast, cheap, or revolutionary. **It’s just a foundation**—**a pile of dirt and bricks**.  
**What happens next? That’s on us.**  

- **Weak hands will leave.**  
- **Doubters will laugh.**  
- **But builders? They will build.**  

## 🤝 Strength in Unity  
History isn’t written by those who wait. It’s written by those who **move first**, who **stand together**, who **create something from nothing**.  

🧱 One brick is just a brick.
🧱 A dozen bricks are just weight.
🧱 But when stacked with purpose? They become empires.

⚠️ The Choice is Yours
No roadmap. No safety net. No rulers. Just raw opportunity.
DirtBricks belongs to no one, yet it’s built by everyone.

You can stand by and watch the foundation rise—or you can lay the first stone yourself.

Will you build, or will you watch?
