# 🧱 DirtBricks – Built by Us, Owned by No One  

Forget the promises. Forget the hype.  

DirtBricks isn’t here to **convince** you of its worth—because **blockchains, tokens, and names have no inherent value**.  
The **only** real value? **The fire in our souls. The strength of our hands. The force of our collective will.**  

## 💀 No Guarantees. No Handouts. Just Opportunity.  
DirtBricks doesn’t promise to be fast, cheap, or revolutionary. **It’s just a foundation**—**a pile of dirt and bricks**.  
**What happens next? That’s on us.**  

- **Weak hands will leave.**  
- **Doubters will laugh.**  
- **But builders? They will build.**  

## 🤝 Strength in Unity  
History isn’t written by those who wait. It’s written by those who **move first**, who **stand together**, who **create something from nothing**.  

🧱 **Dirt alone is worthless.**  
🧱 **Bricks alone are heavy.**  
🧱 **But together? We build kingdoms.**  

## ⚠️ The Choice is Yours  
There is no roadmap. No safety net. No centralized power to hold your hand.  
DirtBricks **belongs to no one and everyone at the same time**.  

You can stand by and **watch others lay the first bricks**—or you can **pick one up yourself**.  

**What will you do?**
